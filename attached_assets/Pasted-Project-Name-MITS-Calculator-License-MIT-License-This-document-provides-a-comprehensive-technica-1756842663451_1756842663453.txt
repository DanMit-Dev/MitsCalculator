Project Name: MITS Calculator
License: MIT License
This document provides a comprehensive technical overview for the MITS Calculator project. It is designed to be a self-contained, standalone desktop application for Linux with a "local-first" and 100% offline philosophy.

#1. Core Philosophy: The Triple Focus
Personal Mathematics: The calculator adapts to the user. Privacy, extreme customization, and the instantaneous speed of local processing are at its heart.

Living Mathematics: Mathematics is an experience. The tool is designed for exploring, visualizing, and interacting with concepts, transforming calculation into discovery.

Universal Mathematics: The tool is for everyone. With a focus on accessibility and an open plugin ecosystem, the calculator is a platform that grows and adapts to any need.

#2. Architecture and Technology Stack
The MITS Calculator is a pure standalone desktop application for Linux. All logic and data reside locally on the user's machine, and no custom backend or internet connection is required for core functionality.

Core Framework: .NET 8 with Avalonia UI to create a cross-platform desktop application using C# and a flexible, XAML-based UI framework.

Programming Language: C# for type safety and scalability.

Styling: A utility-first styling approach will be implemented using a custom theme or a library like Avalonia.Controls.SimpleTheme for a clean, highly customizable design system. The application will feature two core themes, a Light Mode and a Dark Mode, and the colors will be defined using CSS variables for easy user customization. The dark theme will use a palette of deep grays and blues, while the light theme will use a clean palette of light grays and whites.

Database: SQLite for all local data persistence (history, variables, formulas, settings). The application will interact with the database file via a C# library like Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.

Mathematical Engine:

Math.NET Numerics: For core functionality including basic arithmetic, complex numbers, matrices, unit conversions, and a robust expression parser.

SymPySharp or NCalc: For highly specialized tasks like the Computer Algebra System (CAS) and symbolic math, a specialized C# library will be used for high performance.

Graphing and Visualization:

OxyPlot or ScottPlot: For 2D and statistical plotting.

Helix Toolkit: For all 3D function plotting, simulations, and AR features.

Hardware and AI Acceleration: The calculator will use GPU acceleration for complex algebra, matrix calculations, and 3D graphics, ensuring instantaneous performance on demanding tasks. It will also include a resource optimization algorithm that detects the device's capabilities and adjusts the complexity of simulations, such as the frame rate of 3D graphics or the number of simulated particles, to ensure smooth performance even on older hardware.

#3. Local Data Persistence: The Offline Core
All application data is stored in a single SQLite database file (user_data.db) located in the user's local application support directory. This ensures all data is private, portable, and fully offline.

Local Database Schema: A relational structure will be used to store user data.

History Table: id, expression, result, timestamp

Variables Table: id, name, value, is_custom_function

Formulas Table: id, name, expression, variables

Settings Table: key, value (for UI state, themes, etc.)

Projects Table: id, name, project_data_json, timestamp

Security and Privacy: Data encryption will use professional-grade algorithms like AES-256. The application and the local AI model (Gemma 3 4B) will run in separate, secure sandboxes to prevent unauthorized file system access. Users can enter a Privacy and Security Audit Mode at any time to see exactly what data is stored locally and delete it with a single click.

Smart Updates and Data Cache: The calculator will have the ability to download and store the latest data (such as the Periodic Table, exchange rates, and physical constants) whenever an internet connection is available. This ensures data is always fresh while maintaining the offline-first functionality and eliminating the need for constant updates.
